            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. The education sector or education system is a group of
                institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions,
                schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people
                in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people (curriculum developers, inspectors, school
                principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different
                contexts.[42]

                Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements
                such as education policies and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning
                materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both
                physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that
                should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.[42] The Organisation for Economic
                Co-operation and Development has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full
                authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation.
                They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. Governments should
                limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.[43]

                The education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with numerous stakeholders
                and other sectors. These include parents, local communities, religious leaders, NGOs, stakeholders
                involved in health, child protection, justice and law enforcement (police), media and political
                leadership</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[4]

                In China, Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like
                Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt
                his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to
                influence education in East Asia into the modern era.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary
                education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a
                high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and
                postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities mainly
                provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions.
                Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic
                degrees.

                The ISCED distinguishes 4 levels of tertiary education. ISCED 6 is equivalent to a first degree, ISCED 7
                is equivalent to a masters or an advanced professional qualification and ISCED 8 is an advanced research
                qualification, usually concluding with the submission and defence of a substantive dissertation of
                publishable quality based on original research.[21] The category ISCED 5 is reserved for short-cycle
                courses of requiring degree level study.[21]

                Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or foundation degree qualification. In
                most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at
                some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national economies, both as a
                significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of
                the economy.</p>
